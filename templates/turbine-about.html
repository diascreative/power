  This is an experiment using realtime data to tell stories about
  renewable energy.
</p>

<p>
  The turbine spins faster or slower in response to the amount of wind
  power currently being generated at that moment (updated every five
  minutes).
</p>

<p>
  Wind is often derided as relatively unimportant, so we thought it would
  be nice to show the increasingly important role
  <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/james-blog/2361031/renewables-records-reveal-how-clean-energy-is-starting-to-light-up-the-world">
    it plays in a balanced mix of energy generation</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We wanted to make MWh something more tangible, so we've taken some data*
  on the average energy usage of domestic products to hopefully bring
  those big numbers to life.</p>

<p>
  We also wanted to show the increasing importance of wind in the energy
  mix over time and the graph allows us to do that in a simple way as well
  as giving us a means of navigating across time. You can change the date
  range on the graph to show longer term trends.
</p>

<p>
  We are aware that numbers can be used to tell all sorts of stories, and
  that this is just one narrative among many possible ones. We choose to
  shine a positive light on the amount of energy being generated by wind.
  For a more rigorous interpretation of energy data, you should read David

<p>
  So please take this in the manner it was created: as a lightweight
  experiment in real(-ish) time data interpretation.

  *The numbers on energy consumption come from http://www.absak.com/library/power-consumption-table, http://www.frequencycast.co.uk/howmanywatts.html and http://www.renewableuk.com/en/renewable-energy/wind-energy/uk-wind-energy-database/figures-explained.cfm#sthash.lEqs5FDf.dpuf.

<p>
  The wind energy data comes from the amazing labour of love that is
  http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/. We take the download csv that is
  generated every 5 minutes and pop that into a mysql database that we can
  query.
