  <h1>About Winderful</h1>

  <p>
    This is an experiment using realtime data to tell stories about
    renewable energy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The turbine spins faster or slower in response to the amount of wind
    power currently being generated at that moment (updated every five
    minutes).
  </p>

  <p>
    Wind is often derided as relatively unimportant, so we thought it would
    be nice to show the increasingly important role
    <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/james-blog/2361031/renewables-records-reveal-how-clean-energy-is-starting-to-light-up-the-world" target="_blank">
      it plays in a balanced mix of energy generation</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We wanted to make MWh something more tangible, so we've taken some data*
    on the average energy usage of domestic products to hopefully bring
    those big numbers to life.</p>

  <p>
    We also wanted to show the increasing importance of wind in the energy
    mix over time and the graph allows us to do that in a simple way as well
    as giving us a means of navigating across time. You can change the date
    range on the graph to show longer term trends.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are aware that numbers can be used to tell all sorts of stories, and
    that this is just one narrative among many possible ones. We choose to
    shine a positive light on the amount of energy being generated by wind.
    For a more rigorous interpretation of energy data, you should read David
    Mackayâ€™s

      Sustainable Energy - Without Hot Air
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    So please take this in the manner it was created: as a lightweight
    experiment in real(-ish) time data interpretation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wind energy data comes from the amazing labour of love that is
    <a href="http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/</a>. We take the download csv that is
    generated every 5 minutes and pop that into a mysql database that we can
    query.
